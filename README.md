## :elephant: Frameworks
**OpenGL**, OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a free API used in computer graphics, for the development of graphics applications, 3D environments, games, among others. Like Direct3D or Glide, it is an API (Application Programming Interface), a term used to classify a library of specific functions made available for the creation and development of applications.
